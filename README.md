### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language that is essential for web development. It enables developers to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. As the core language of the web, JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to create interactive and engaging web experiences.

### Key Features

- **Versatility**: JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development, making it a full-stack language.
- **Interactivity**: Add dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing for rich user interactions.
- **Compatibility**: JavaScript runs consistently across all modern web browsers and devices.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: A vast ecosystem of frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) and libraries (e.g., jQuery, D3.js) enhances JavaScript's functionality and simplifies development.
